    "#### <span style=\"color:#1F618D\">Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey question before they get access to the content on the page. Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3. After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65% said Yes and 35% said No. What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes? Hint: use the rule of total probability.</span>"
